    <h1>The Story of Solar Man</h1>
    <p>The date was 26 December 2019. </p><p>A large part of the SLS team were on the roof of MOE HQ BV, awaiting the Solar Eclipse. <br>SK and Ben had pre-ordered Solar Eclipse Glasses and had distributed to various people gathered at the rooftop. <br>Seeing that it was not yet the full eclipse, GK decided to hide in the shade. <br><strong>It was at this moment that Solar Man was borned!</strong><br> As a JC Physics lecturer himself, he lamented "Funny hor? Why sit here cannot see the eclipse?" SK and Ben, both Physics teachers, looked at GK in awe: "Light travels in a straight line, 6th grade Physics. You hiding in the shade, means light is blocked, right?" <br>It must have been less than a second, before GK's face turned full red. Ben said, "Cher, only you can bend light is it?" To which GK quickly replied,"Please don't tell others I made this comment." <br>Hence, Solar Man was created. <br>Special thanks to Georgi for touching up the original photo.</p>
